# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First, I determined the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

#1. What is the average popularity by artist and track? 

SELECT avg(popularity), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#2. What is the average danceability by artist and track? 

SELECT avg(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name


#3. What is the average evergy by artist and track? 

SELECT avg(energy), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name


#Then, I determined the top 10 artists based on popularity. 
#4. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity

SELECT track_name,artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#Last, I determined the artist that released the longest song. 
#5. What artist released the longest song?

Select artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms
